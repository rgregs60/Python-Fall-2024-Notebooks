This transformation is done to simplify the data into binary-like categories where 0 represents disagreement or neutrality, and 100 represents strong agreement.\n",

    "Following this, the script renames these columns to reflect the changes made. The new column names are 'Performance Agree Top Box (7)%', 'Ease_of_Use Agree Top Box (7)%', and 'Maintenance Agree Top Box (7)%'. This renaming helps in making the DataFrame more descriptive and easier to understand.\n",

It then creates a line plot with these mean values.
